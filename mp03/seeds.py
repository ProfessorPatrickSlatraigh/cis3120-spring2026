Seeded data for Mini-Project MP03 — Press Release to Plot: Industry Comparison.

These lists are starting points provided by the instructor. Teams are expected
to modify both the ticker lists and the phrase lists during the project.
Modifications must be justified in the methodology section.

The seeds were chosen to give each industry a working starting point, not to
be optimal. The Financial Services seed is biased toward retail-banking events
and undercounts capital-markets activity; the Travel and Hospitality seed
mixes hotel-style and airline-style location events that may warrant separate
treatment in your map. Identifying these limitations and proposing fixes is
the methodology section's purpose.
